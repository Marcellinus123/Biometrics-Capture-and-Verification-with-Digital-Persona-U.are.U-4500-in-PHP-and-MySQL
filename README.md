# Biometrics-Capture-and-Verification-with-Digital-Persona-U.are.U-4500-in-PHP-and-MySQL
A PHP + MySQL project for capturing and verifying fingerprints with the Digital Persona U.are.U 4500 scanner. Features secure enrollment, template storage, and verification for authentication systems such as attendance, exams, banking, and access control.

This system was developed to provide a reliable solution for capturing and verifying students’ biometric data using the Digital Persona U.are.U 4500 fingerprint scanner. The main purpose is to ensure accurate bio-data registration and verification of students at the beginning of every semester, which can then be reused for attendance taking, exam verification, and other academic-related authentications. By leveraging biometrics, the system eliminates impersonation and strengthens trust in student identity management.

The platform is built with PHP and MySQL as its core technologies, providing an admin dashboard where administrators can securely log in and manage student records. The admin has full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for student data, ensuring that all bio-data remains accurate and up to date. Once student records are prepared, administrators can move to the enrollment phase where fingerprint data is captured directly from the U.are.U 4500 scanner. Each fingerprint template is linked to the student’s profile and stored securely in the database for future use.

During verification, students simply place their finger on the scanner, and the system compares the captured template with the stored record. If a match is found, the system confirms the student’s identity. This verification step is crucial during high-stakes activities such as examinations and semester registrations, where preventing impersonation is a top priority. The same process can also be extended to classroom attendance, automatically marking students present when their fingerprint is successfully verified.

One major limitation of the U.are.U 4500 is that while it provides fingerprint capture functionality, the manufacturer did not provide a built-in verification system. To address this, we integrated a custom fingerprint matching module written in Python, which runs as a Flask-based API service. The PHP application communicates with this Python service whenever a fingerprint needs to be verified.

The Python backend uses several important libraries and algorithms to handle the verification process. OpenCV (cv2) is used for image preprocessing, NumPy provides efficient matrix operations, and scikit-learn’s cosine similarity is employed to measure the closeness between fingerprint templates. Fingerprint images are converted into feature vectors and compared with stored templates in the MySQL database. A similarity score is then calculated, and if it exceeds the threshold, the fingerprint is considered a match. The entire process is designed to be efficient, secure, and reliable.

By combining PHP for data management, MySQL for secure storage, and Python with Flask for fingerprint verification, this project delivers a robust biometric solution that can be adapted to multiple real-world use cases. While it was originally built for student bio-data management in universities, the same approach can easily be applied in other fields such as employee attendance tracking, secure building access, or financial services authentication.

This project demonstrates how cross-technology integration can bridge the gaps left by hardware manufacturers and deliver a complete end-to-end biometric solution. It ensures that institutions can confidently verify identities and streamline their processes without relying solely on traditional methods like ID cards, which can be forged or misused.
