# Biometrics-Capture-and-Verification-with-Digital-Persona-U.are.U-4500-in-PHP-and-MySQL  

A **PHP + MySQL** project for capturing and verifying fingerprints with the **Digital Persona U.are.U 4500 scanner**.  
This system features secure enrollment, template storage, and verification for authentication systems such as **student bio-data registration, attendance, exams, banking, and access control**.

## üñêÔ∏è Fingerprint Enrollment  

This section is the backbone of the system.  

The administrator connects the **Digital Persona U.are.U 4500 fingerprint scanner** via USB. The manufacturer‚Äôs Web SDK allows fingerprint **capture** but does not provide **verification**. After installing the SDK, the admin can enroll fingerprints directly into the system.  

The process:  
1. Select a student from the system.  
2. Place the student‚Äôs finger on the scanner.  
3. Capture and save the fingerprint template.  
4. The template is stored securely in the database as a PNG.  

If the scanner is not connected, the system throws an error.

## üîç Fingerprint Verification  

The **main challenge** was integrating fingerprint verification inside the browser.  
Since the original Web SDK from Digital Persona does **not provide verification or matching**, we implemented our own algorithm in **Python**, served via a **Flask API**.  

The PHP application captures a fingerprint, sends it to the Flask server, and waits for a verification response. If a match is found, the server queries the MySQL database and returns the associated student data.  

### Python Fingerprint Matching  

The file `finger_clean.py` handles all fingerprint matching logic.  
It uses:  
- **OpenCV (cv2)** for image preprocessing.  
- **NumPy** for efficient matrix operations.  
- **scikit-learn‚Äôs cosine similarity** for fingerprint comparison.  
- **Flask** to serve the verification API.

## üåê System Architecture  

This project requires **two servers** running simultaneously:  
1. **XAMPP/Apache** ‚Üí Handles PHP + MySQL.  
2. **Python Flask API** ‚Üí Handles fingerprint verification (`finger_clean.py`).

## üîÑ Verification Workflow  

1. A student places their finger on the scanner.  
2. The system captures a new fingerprint template.  
3. The captured fingerprint is sent via API request to the Flask server (running on port 5000).  
4. The Flask server compares the fingerprint against stored templates in MySQL.  
5. If a match is found, the server returns the associated student record.

## üìñ Project Description  

This system was developed to provide a reliable solution for capturing and verifying student biometric data using the Digital Persona U.are.U 4500 fingerprint scanner. Its primary purpose is **accurate bio-data registration and verification of students each semester**, ensuring that identity checks during **attendance, examinations, and other academic processes** are free from impersonation.  

The platform is built with **PHP and MySQL**, providing an admin dashboard where administrators can securely log in and manage student records. Once student records are created, administrators move to the enrollment phase, where fingerprint data is captured directly from the scanner and stored in the database.  

During verification, students simply place their finger on the scanner, and the system compares the captured template with the stored record. If a match is found, the student‚Äôs identity is confirmed. This workflow is particularly critical during examinations and semester registrations.  

Since the U.are.U 4500 scanner lacks a built-in verification endpoint, we developed a **custom fingerprint verification system in Python with Flask**. This Python service leverages **OpenCV, NumPy, and cosine similarity** to compare fingerprints and ensure accurate matches.  

By combining **PHP (data management)**, **MySQL (storage)**, and **Python Flask (verification)**, this project delivers a **complete end-to-end biometric solution**. While originally designed for student bio-data management, it can also be extended to **employee attendance systems, building access control, and financial services authentication**.  

This project showcases how **cross-technology integration** can bridge gaps left by hardware manufacturers and deliver a **scalable, secure, and reliable biometric verification system**.
